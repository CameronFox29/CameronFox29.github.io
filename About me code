<pre>
    Hello my name is Cameron Fox I am a Northport high school senior; I enjoy listening to music, hanging with the bois, and doing athletic activities.
The thing I love to do most with music is to try to find the best music to go witht the activitiy I am doing weather it is writting a 30 page essay or just
doing 30 reps at the gym. I enjoy skating with the bois as well as talkin with them about the random stuff we talk about, it always makes me laugh and its 
dull with them always entertaining. I enjoy playing soccer with my buddies they are always fun to play with and we all always have a good time but maybe not the 
other team.

    I have a job at a Marina where I help custemers onto and out of boats as well as clean and take care of those boats. For example if a member destroys a prop we have
to fix it, or if a member shatters a window its my responsabilaty to clean up the mess and replace it. This is a tough job mainly because of the members and how the treat
me and my fellow staff members. Most of the Club members talk to us like they are the only person in the word then treat us like we are less than human. Now you might be 
this is a terrible job why would i work here and the counter argument I say to that is this job really showed me how to deal with people. As well as how to be a better 
person all together.
